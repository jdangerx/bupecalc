# Bupecalc

Calculate and visualize dosage for various types of buprenorphine.

Designed to be used online and then printed out in landscape mode.

## TODO

* [ ] add subutex, which is a pill instead of a strip - though we can model this as a 2x1 strip for now
* [ ] add multiple preset regimens to choose between
* [ ] update the belbuca and suboxone strip colors

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
